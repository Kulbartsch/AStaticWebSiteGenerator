# ASWSG - Another|Alexanders Static WebSite Generator

ASWSG allows you to generate Websites using Markup Syntax and HTML.

* *make friendly* - to be integrated in your workflow
* *adaptable syntax* - to match different markup dialects

It is build with the idea of classical UNIX tools to do one job.
ASWSG behaves just like a compiler parsing a Markup file and generating a new HTML output.
ASWSG will not generate a file structure or an HTML frame, but you can do so using includes and
use it with a build system like *make*.

HTML and Markup can be mixed, reusable includes may be used for headers, footers and other repeating code blocks.
Most benefits come from using dynamic variables, which are partly set dynamically by aswsg,
by the document or via the command line and the include system.
In example the current *date*, *time* and the actual *filename* is set dynamically, *author*, *creation date*
and others in the document, the *sitename* as a command line parameter.
But it is even possible to redefine markup symbols due to different markup dialects.
(i.E. use "!" instead/as well of "=" for headers.)
All variables can be used subsequent, also in included files. (i.E. using the article name in a header include.)

This tool will generate new HTML code, which -- of course -- may contain dynamic code.

**Note: This is under development but usable.**
