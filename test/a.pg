== Here starts the contend

This is a simple paragraph.
It spans several line.
But contains just nonsense.

Another parapraph.
The time is
\{{now}}

> Just do it!
> Try it out!

== Header 2 - Lists ===
Foo is: {{Foo}}

Now we have a list here.
* Are we happy?
* do we like it
** or not
* we will see
*# if it works
*## or not
*## or maybe
*# test some ``code`` inside a line

== inline foo ==
I can haz *cookies* with //Milk//!
Don't need ~~meat~~ to be happy.
Ah ... links should do to [[https://wikipedia.org/]] for example.
