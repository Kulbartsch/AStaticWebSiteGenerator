== Here's the aswsg condition test!

(cond-if-set clp
You set the command line parameter CLP to {{clp}}.
(cond-else
You might want to try to set command line parameter CLP to something like CLP:Hello!
(cond-end

Let's try conditions with an include having two parts.

First without having "part" set.  
+condition.in

Setting part to 1 and include. 
@part:1
+condition.in

Now change part to 2 and include.
@part:2
+condition.in

Now change part to something and include.
@part:something
+condition.in

That's it for now.
